        <H3>What is this?</H3>

        <P>I've been studying from <A href="https://contextualelectronics.com/">Contextual
          Electronics</A>, and had a silly idea on the back of one of
          their "make a blinky" tutorials. Wouldn't it be cool to have
          Morse blinkies? (Not really.) And wouldn't it be cool to
          generate them programmatically on demand? (Er. No.)</P>

        <P>So, we've had PaaS (Platform as a Service), IaaS
          (Infrastructure as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Server).
          But is the world ready for Morse Blinkies as a Service?
          (MBaaS, obviously.)</P>

        <H3>Enough talk already. I want my blinky!</H3>

        <P>Enter some text on the front page, pick some options, press
          the big blue button and in a few seconds you'll get a link to
          a ZIP file containing KiCad files that implement a Morse
          blinky blinking out your text.</P>

        <P>Here, "KiCad files" means a netlist, some footprint libraries
          (to keep everything nicely self-contained) and a README
          telling you what to do with it all. You'll need to do the PCB
          layout for your blinky yourself: that's the artistic part!</P>

        <H3>What's in my blinky?</H3>

        <P>There's a 555 timer (of course), one or more LEDs with
          current-limiting resistors, and in between there's some
          74xx-based logic to decide when to switch the LEDs on and off.</P>

        <P>The logic is just some counters and some AND and OR gates.
          You count through the bits in the sequence of on/off states
          you need to blink the message, and use logic based on the bits
          of the binary count to switch the LEDs on and off.</P>

        <H3>What are the options?</H3>

        <UL>
          <LI><STRONG>LEDs</STRONG>: you can choose between "blink a
            single LED" or "blink multiple LED groups, one group per
            letter". That means you can make a blinky with LEDs laid out
            in letter shapes.</LI>

          <LI><STRONG>Speed</STRONG>: you can choose a blink rate.</LI>

          <LI><STRONG>Footprints</STRONG>: you can change the footprints
            used for the different components in the blinky by
            downloading, editing and reuploading a JSON rules file. Let's
            consider that advanced usage. You'll figure it out if you
            really care.</LI>
        </UL>

        <H3>How does it work?</H3>

        <P>For such a stupid little project, MBaaS uses some
          surprisingly powerful technology. More stepping on the toes of
          giants than standing on their shoulders... Here's the process:</P>

        <OL>
          <LI>Your blinky text is converted into an on/off bit
            sequence representing Morse dots, dashes and the spaces in
            between them by some custom Python code.</LI>

          <LI>A representation of the on/off state of each LED at each
            step in the bit sequence is generated. You can think of this
            as a big bunch of ANDs feeding into a big OR gate (well, one
            OR per LED).</LI>

          <LI>The AND/OR logic generated in the previous step (which
            has one AND per on state, all leading into a mighty big
            OR) is simplified using the <A href="https://github.com/classabbyamp/espresso-logic">Espresso</A> heuristic logic minimiser. This results in a much smaller and more manageable logic expression to be realised in gates.</LI>

          <LI>The simplified logic from Espresso is placed onto "real"
            AND and OR gates from commonly available 74xx logic
            (basically 2-, 3- and 4-input ANDs and 2-input ORs), and
            those real gates are assigned to real 74xx chips. This is
            done with some more custom Python code (using a dumb
            greedy algorithm that does a reasonable job, but could be
            optimised).</LI>

          <LI>The gate assignments and the connections between the gates
            are used to drive some code that uses <A href="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/">SKIDL</A> to generate a KiCad netlist.</LI>
        </OL>

        <H3>Why did you do this?</H3>

        <P>Seemed like a good idea at the time. It's obviously
          completely useless, but since I'm mostly a programmer, not a
          hardware person, I wanted to see how easy it was to generate
          hardware programmatically. This application is dumb, but I
          can think of lots of cases where I might do something like
          this that aren't dumb. (Also, I've been thinking of it as my
          "compile to silicon" project, which makes it sound a hundred
          times more cool than it is.)</P>

        <P>If SKIDL was more fully integrated into KiCad's schematic
          editor, for example, so that you could include blocks of
          SKIDL code as components in your schematics, you'd open up a
          lot of possibilities. The tedious things where a schematic
          is no real benefit (bypass caps, connecting buses, repeated
          patterns of components), you could do with SKIDL, but you
          could still have the benefit of having a schematic for the
          parts where that visual representation is helpful.</P>

        <H3>Wow!  What's next for MBaaS?</H3>

        <P>Eh, not much, to be honest. It's mostly a joke. And not
          even a very funny one.</P>

        <P>You could improve it in various ways. You could improve the
          logic placement algorithm (which is, being generous, not of
          the highest quality). You could generate a schematic as well
          as a netlist. You could generate a simulation of the blinky
          using something like <A href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html">Logisim</A> to verify that it works (Logisim is a nice little tool). You could (somehow) make the output more editable/customisable (that would probably need some SKIDL integration into Eeschema).</P>
